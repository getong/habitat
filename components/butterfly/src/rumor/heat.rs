//! In Butterfly, as in life, new rumors are "hot", but they get less
//! exciting the more you hear them. For a given rumor, we keep track
//! of how many times we've sent it to each member. Once we've sent
//! that member the rumor a maximum number of times, the rumor has
//! "cooled off". At that point we'll stop sending that rumor to the
//! member; by now they will have heard it!
//!
//! Note that the "heat" of a rumor is tracked *per member*, and is
//! not global.

// TODO (CM): Can we key by member instead? What do we do more frequently?
// TODO (CM): Might want to type the member ID explicitly
// TODO (CM): what do we do with rumors that have officially
// "cooled off"? Can we just remove them?
